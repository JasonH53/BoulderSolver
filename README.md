# Boulder Game Solver

This program provides a solution for the puzzle game Boulder. It allows users to place boulders on a 7x7 grid and then solves the puzzle to find the optimal path to the finishing point.

## How it Works

Users can place boulders on the grid by clicking squares, with the top and bottom rows remaining empty. Pressing the solve button will run an algorithm to find the shortest path to the finish, taking into account rules like only being able to push boulders one space at a time.

Hints reveal the solution incrementally with each button press.
